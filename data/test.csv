195,copenhagenâ€™s true effect yet to be seen,"the copenhagen accord is the vaguest possible document, but it does recognise the need to contain temperature rises below 2Â°c, the threshold above which scientists suggest there will be dangerous climate change. there is a pledge of an extra $30bn of â€œquick startâ€ financing for developing countries by 2012; a target of $100bn from developed countries to finance mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and a commitment to tackle deforestation. what is lacking is any detail about how any of this will be achieved or any legal obligation on anyone to live up to their commitments.",favorable
89,london set to be first green city,"the 900 buildings run by the greater london authority group, which includes tfl, the metropolitan police authority, london fire authority and london devÂ­elÂ­opment agency, could save up to 50,000 tonnes of carbon emissions and Â£1m in lower energy bills each year.",favorable
139,global warming: how not to mobilise the masses,"the debate has exposed the broader problem. much as i sympathise with the suggestion that people power will be essential in the effort to slow, and eventually, halt global warming, governments cannot allow the climate change argument to be framed either by self-interested businesses or by well-intentioned activists.",unfavorable
386,we risk more haiyans if we ignore climate change,"the real lesson of the past 19 climate conferences is that fear of climate change, though utterly justified, is insufficient to achieve political results. but climate control advocates can still win. world opinion will rally to their side. most of the public does not own equity in energy companies and is far more interested in their daily bread than the exxon share price. the public will side with science.",unfavorable
330,budget 2013: winners and losers,"tax relief to promote early investment in shale gas was announced as the chancellor declared it was â€œpart of the futureâ€ and â€œwe will make it happenâ€. after lobbying from the mp for stoke on trent central, the chancellor said he would exempt potters from the climate change levy for fear higher energy costs would damage the cityâ€™s ceramics industry. other industries might also benefit, he said.

205,david stevenson: it takes a longer-term view for green assets to bloom,"another low came when the us governmentâ€™s attempts to introduce primary legislation ran aground on partisan squabbles â€“ a proposed climate bill stalled last autumn in the senate. climate change sceptics are increasingly on the offensive, and even the venerable environmental scientist and green icon james lovelock has questioned whether humans can really prevent climate change.",unfavorable
392,potential for co-operation over arctic,"similarly, arctic sustainability and solutions to climate change require real global (read asian) participation in arctic governance. it was this belief that last may made the us and norway push through asiaâ€™s new formal role in the arctic council, against the opposition of many otherwise responsible governments. china deserves the chance to show the world that it can shoulder such an opportunity.",favorable
43,ask the experts: getting to grips with global warming,"adam kirkman: carbon capture and storage is certainly one of the more promising technologies that will play a key role in reducing carbon emissions over the longer term. we have to take into account, however, that ccs is still as much as 20 years or more away from full commercialisation at the large scale suggested in your question. the cdm has in fact already started dealing with the issue, with many informal and formal discussions taking place in montreal on how to credibly make ccs work as a cdm project activity. further input is being sought from the unfccc and many technical uncertainties need to be addressed such as leakage issues. establishing robust cdm methodologies for ccs is a challenging exercise ",unfavorable

62,"morgan stanley, uk govt back huge boost in carbon trading","the drive to tackle climate change is gathering pace with morgan stanleyâ€™s announcement yesterday of a $3bn plan to invest in carbon credits, just days before a uk government report is expected to propose a huge expansion of the global market for trading carbon emissions. morgan stanley also plans to set up its own low-emission energy projects. the uk government-commissioned review, led by sir nicholas stern, former world bank chief economist, will say that the cost of rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere far outweighs the cost of acting now to slow global warming. the prospect of building an international consensus on the back of the findings appeared to strengthen as citigroup said carbon trading was almost certainly going to become the most important weapon in combating global warming, including in the us.

332,concern rises at lack of energy â€˜plan bâ€™,"failure to build the reactors could make it much more expensive for the uk to meet its legally binding climate change targets and lead to a greater reliance on natural gas imports to make up the shortfall, according to the report by the energy and climate change committee.

161,climate policy picks the wrong target,the explanation is simple. green measures that herald a gradual tightening of policy over the coming decades exert a stronger downward pressure on future prices than on current ones. the owners of oil and gas fields react by pulling forward production. that is the green paradox: efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the future have the effect of accelerating climate change now.,unfavorable
